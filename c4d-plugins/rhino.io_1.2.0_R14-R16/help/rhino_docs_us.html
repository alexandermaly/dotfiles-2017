<h1>Rhino Import/Export</h1>
<small>Version 1.1 for CINEMA 4D R12</small>


<p>rhino.io is an Import/Export plugin for <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com" target="_blank">Rhino</a> scenes using
the <a href="http://www.opennurbs.org/" target="_blank">OpenNURBS toolkit</a>. It requires CINEMA 4D R12 or
higher and can read Rhino files up to version 5. Rhino files exported through rhino.io will be saved as Rhino
Version 4 files, so they can be read by Rhino 4 and 5. The most up to date information can be found on the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rhino.io">official support website</a>.</p>

<p>You can always download the most recent versions of rhino.io for CINEMA 4D from the
<a href="http://www.rhino.io" target="_blank">support website</a>. The Zip-File contains both,
the windows version and a Universal Binary for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>After downloading the rhino.io Zip-File, unzip it and copy the folder into the 'plugins' folder
of your CINEMA 4D application directory. The screenshots below show the correct locations for
Windows and Mac OS X users respectively.</p>

<h3><a name="license">Obtaining a License</a></h3>

<p>After you installed rhino.io as a CINEMA 4D plugin, you need to obtain a rhino.io license. This
license is generated based on the rhino.io serial you received on purchase, as well as the CINEMA 4D
serial of the installation you want to use rhino.io with. Do not use the temporary CINEMA 4D serial
you get on purchase of CINEMA 4D, but the final number you get after registering with MAXON.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get your license code, is to start CINEMA 4D with the plugin installed. It
will complain about the missing rhino.io license and bring up the <i>Register</i> window. Ignore this by
pressing cancel, CINEMA 4D will continue to load. In the <i>Plugins</i> Menu you will find an entry
called <i>Register rhino.io</i>. Clicking this entry will bring up the registration website with most of
the info already filled in from what you entered in CINEMAs Register window. Finish filling out
this form and click submit. The license will then be sent instantly to the e-mail adress you
supplied.</p>

<p>You can also directly visit the registration website here:
<a href="http://www.rhino.io/register/" target="_blank">www.rhino.io/register/</a>. If there
are any problems with obtaining a license, please check the <a href="http://www.rhino.io" target="_blank">
support website</a> or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@rhino.io">info@rhino.io</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="import">Rhino Import</a></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="importgeneral">General Operation</a></h3>

<p class="important">The Rhino Importer will load Rhino Mesh Objects as they are, but it is unable
to tesselate NURBS Objects. Rhino can, however, store Render Meshes with NURBS objects in a 3dm file,
which are then used for import. These meshes are created by Rhino automatically as long as they have
at least once been rendered or drawn into the viewport in shaded mode. Also make sure the
<i>Save Small</i> flag is not checked when the file is saved. Some other applications using the 3dm
file format may not automatically store Render Meshes with the file, so in that case you will have
to explicitly tesselate them or go through Rhino first. When a NURBS/Brep object without render
meshes is encountered in the rendered file, a warning message is issued.</p>

<p>For proper import, you can convert NURBS objects into meshes within Rhino manually before you
import them into CINEMA 4D. Otherwise you need to have the tesselation settings set correctly. Check this
either in the global Rhino Options under <i>Render mesh quality</i> or individually in the Render mesh
setting of an object.</p>

<p>The exact behaviour of the Rhino Import is guided by a number of settings, which come up every time
a file is imported and can always be found under <i>Edit -> Preferences -> Import/Export -> Rhino (*.3dm) Import</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="importoptions">Import Options</a></h3>

<p><img src="import_us.png" alt="Import Options"></p>

<p><b>Document Scale</b> determines how the Rhino model is scaled on import. For both cases the
geometry is read from the Rhino file as is and the CINEMA 4D Document Unit is set accordingly. It
defaults to <i>From Rhino File</i>, which just sets the CINEMA 4D document unit to be whatever
the unit is in the imported file. <i>Custom</i> will set the document unit to whatever you chose
in the line below. Keep in mind that if you merge a Rhino file into another document, the objects
will be scaled from the unit in the file or you specify to the unit of the document you merge into.</p>

<p><b>Import Layers</b> controls how Rhino layers are imported. It defaults to <i>As Layers</i>,
meaning Rhino Layers are directly converted to CINEMA layers. For certain workflows it might be
more appropriate to import layers as Null Objects and group all objects on the layer (and
sublayers) thereunder. This is what <i>As Groups</i> does. Layers, that have no content, will never
be imported.To completely ignore layers, set this option to <i>Off</i>.</p>

<p>If you want to <b>Create Materials</b> from Rhino materials, set this option to <i>From Rhino
Materials</i>. It is also possible to have materials created <i>From Layer Colors</i>. If you do
not want any materials to be created, set this option to <i>Off</i>.</p>

<p><b>Clean Up Materials</b> will remove any unused or duplicate material from the Rhino scene.
Unused materials can come from objects that the Rhino Importer doesn't import, duplicate materials
often happen when several objects have materials with identical settings applied.</p>

<p><b>Import Mesh Objects</b> specifies whether Rhino Meshes are imported. If it is not checked,
they are ignored on import.</p>

<p>When <b>Import Render Meshes</b> is checked, the Render Meshes stored with NURBS objects are
imported. This is the way you will probably import most of your data, since the NURBS objects can
not be imported directly.

<p>It is possible to have Rhino Groups imported as Selection Objects. If you want this to happen,
make sure <b>Import Groups</b> is checked.</p>

<p><b>Import Cameras</b> controls whether Named Views from Rhino are imported as Cameras.</p>

<p><b>Import Lights</b> defines if light sources are imported from Rhino. Be aware, that for lights
defined as camera space lights in Rhino, position and orientation may not match!</p>

<p>If <b>Skip Invisible Objects</b> is checked, the importer will ignore all hidden objects,
otherwise they are imported and flagged as hidden within CINEMA 4D.</p>

<p><b>Import Curves</b> will cause NURBS Curves and Polylines in the Rhino file to be imported as
Spline Objects, when checked. While Polylines can be converted precisely, NURBS Curves will be
automatically tesselated creating as many <b>Intermediate Points</b> per span as you specify.</p>

<p>Objects in Rhino usually consist of separate NURBS patches, that are often joined at patch
boundaries or trim curves. These patches are tesselated independently from each other, which causes
duplicate vertices to be created at patch or trim boundaries. When working with these objects in
CINEMA 4D, this is often a waste of resources and can be inconvenient when editing the model or
applying texture coordinates. It is possible to use the <i>Optimize</i> command after import.
Checking the <b>Merge Overlapping Points</b> checkbox does the same thing on import. When the
checkbox is checked <b>Threshold</b> defines the maximum distance two points can have to be
considered the same.</p>

<p>In Rhino objects do not have an axis associated with them, so normally the objects would import
with all their Axes at the origin. If <b>Axis Center Objects</b> is enabled, every objects axis is
moved to the center of the contained points.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="merge">Merge</a></h3>

<p>When <i>Merge</i> is used to open a Rhino file, the importer checks if any objects that have
been imported previosly from the same model already exist in the current CINEMA 4D scene. If that
is the case, a dialog window pops up, asking you if you just want the model to be updated with the
changes you made to the Rhino model. If you choose to do so, changes to objects will be applied
to the existing objects in CINEMA 4D, everything else (like material or layer reassignements or
regrouping of the objects in the object manager) will stay intact.</p>

<p>Rhino attaches unique IDs to all objects and layers. You can see this ID within Rhino by
clicking on <i>Details</i> in the Object Properties Tab. On import, this ID is stored with the
objects and layers (or groups) in CINEMA 4D, so they can be looked up later. When the scene is
updated, the importer checks if any object in the merged Rhino file already exists in the CINEMA
scene and updates the geometry. There are a few things to keep in mind, though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an object has been removed within CINEMA, but still exists in the Rhino scene, it will be
    imported again. If you don't want this to happen you could e.g. hide the object and choose
    <i>Skip Hidden Objects</i> in the import settings.</li>
  <li>Some operations in Rhino (e.g. Join, Explode, Extract) don't keep the object ID intact. In that
    case, the importer doesn't know how the objects relate and imports the object anew.</li>
  <li>If an object is imported that didn't exist previously, the importer tries to put it inside
    the same layer or group, as long as the layer or group already exist. New layers do not get
    added.</li>
  <li>Some attention has to be paid on import settings when updating a scene. If e.g. a scene has
    been originally opened with layers imported as groups and, on merge, layer import is set to
    import as CINEMA 4D layers, new objects will not be sorted into the existing groups, because
    the importer looks for existing layers in the CINEMA 4D layer list.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="vertexcolors">Vertex Colors</a></h3>
<p><img src="vertex_color_shader.png" alt="Vertex Color Shader"></p>
<p>If <i>Vertex Colors</i> are available, rhino.io imports them by creating one Vertex Map for 
each channel. These are named according to the color which they represent.</p>

<p>The file <i>vertex_color_shader.c4d</i> in the <i>examples</i> folder shows a possible application, where a material uses a Layer Shader
to combine the three colors. Each layer is built by a Colorizer Shader with a specific color and the
corresponding Vertex Map assigned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="export">Rhino Export</a></h2>
<h3><a name="exportgeneral">General Operation</a></h3>

<p>A layer called Default is created always, all objects that have no layer assigned in cinema, are
assigned to that layer on export.</p>
<p>The exporter uses viewport visibility, not render visibility, to set Rhino layer visibilities</p>

<p>For advanced users: Be aware that exporting polygon meshes will not retain vertex order. Rhino
can not represent discontinous texture coordinates or normals and the mesh will be processed so
that vertices can be split up in those cases. This has the downside that vertex count and order
will, in most cases, be different.</p>

<p>The Document Unit always also gets stored in the Rhino file.</p>

<p>The exact behaviour of the Rhino Import is guided by a number of settings, which come up at the
time of export and can always be found under <i>Edit -> Preferences -> Import/Export -> Rhino (*.3dm) Export</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="exportoptions">Export Options</a></h3>

<p><img src="export_us.png" alt="Import Options"></p>

<p>If <b>Export Splines</b> is checked, any Spline Objects found in the scene are exported as
polylines. If the box is not checked, Spline Objects are ignored.
